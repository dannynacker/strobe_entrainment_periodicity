Of these, #5 is the most powerful, with the capacity to specify multiple steps, the periodicity of the waveform, their durations, start and end effective frequency (in case an aperiodic waveform is chosen), start and end duty cycle, start and end luminance, a square- or sine- wave-modulated signal, and which of 4 LEDs are to be either ON or OFF per each oscillator (4 total). Recent adjustments include proper formatting of TIM to remove DAY stamps, as well as removal of redundant STP durations per oscillator within each row."
